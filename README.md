# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing various sorting algorithms. It's built with Next.js and TypeScript, allowing users to see the step-by-step process of how different algorithms sort an array of numbers.

## Features

*   **Visualize Sorting Algorithms:** See animations of sorting algorithms in action.
*   **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from a selection of sorting algorithms to compare their processes.
*   **Control the Visualization:** Start, stop, and generate new arrays to visualize.
*   **Step-by-step Logs:** View a log of the comparisons and swaps made by the algorithm.

## Implemented Algorithms

*   Bubble Sort
*   Quick Sort
*   Merge Sort
*   Insertion Sort
*   Selection Sort

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How to Use

1.  **Generate a New Array:** Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a random array of numbers.
2.  **Select an Algorithm:** Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3.  **Start Sorting:** Click the "Sort" button to begin the visualization.
4.  **Stop Sorting:** Click the "Stop" button to halt the sorting process at any time.
